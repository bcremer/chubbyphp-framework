## Description

A minimal framework using [PHP Framework Interop Group - PSR][1]

 * [Basic Coding Standard (1)][2]
 * [Coding Style Guide (2)][3]
 * [Logger Interface (3)][4]
 * [Autoloading Standard (4)][5]
 * [HTTP Message Interface (7)][6]
 * [Container Interface (11)][7]
 * [HTTP Handlers (15)][8]
 * [HTTP Factories (17)][9]

The goal of this framework is to achive the best combination of flexibility and simplicity by using standards.

About flexibility: Everything should be replaceable the a framework user.
About simplicity: Nothing should be more complex than needed to fulfill the flexibility.
